# PySpark playground

A playground for getting familiarized with [PySpark](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/index.html) is established.
PySpark is the Python API for Apache Spark, an open-source framework for distributed big data processing.
The contained examples widely follow the official documentation.

## Getting started

  ```
  pyspark
  ```
